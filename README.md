# Gamers-Zone
-> Gamers Zone Project in C language is a simple console application.
-> Gamers Zone is a space that fills you with excitement and joy as soon as you enter it.
-> Gamers Zone is written in C language which is based on the video games.
-> In this project, you can play the popular games like “TIC-TAC-TOE” and “GUESS THE NUMBER” just like you played it elsewhere. You have to follow the game rules to play these games.
-> These aren’t the world’s greatest games, but it does give us an idea of what we can achieve with a relatively simple C program and perhaps the basis by which to extend the principles and create more interesting projects.
